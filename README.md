# In House Unit (ihu) for a bunch of periferals connected to a Orange Pi Prime SBC

Just that, a python script that handles a series of sensors, actuators and periferals conected to a Orange Pi Prime SBC.

# What periferals?

Actually just one

* DHT11 temp & humidity sensor

The intended list of periferals and devices is a bit longer ;)

* A MOSFET transistor to control one of More 12V fans for cooling in a closed loop with the CPU/GPU temp.
* A OLED and/or SPI display (SSD1306 and ILI3941) to show weather and status info
* A strip of Neopixel ligths
* A BMP180 temp & presure sensor
* nRF24L01 transceiver
* LoRa a lora board
* Others

# This is always an alpha until further notice

This is not production code and can change really fast, this is me testing and modifiying it to meet my needs
